# geolocalize-service

Geocalize service is a solution based on an API
aimed to retrieve retrieve latitude and longitude information
by using a context key. The results are then mapped into a distributed
cache and made available for further requests.

This project is coded in javascript and can be executed by a nodejs server.  

Soon I will create a document describing the system design.
